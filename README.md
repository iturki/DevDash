# DevDash
_**Available on Google Play:**_ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turkidroid.devdash


## What can you do with DevDash?
With DevDash app, every developer can have a *simple widget* that acts as dashboard for his under-development apps. The widget provides shortcuts to common task. Namely, DevDash widget can do the following:
- Launch the App.
- Kill the App's Process.
- Open the App's info page.

## Why use DevDash?
While developing other apps, I needed to visit the App's details page (Settings > Apps > etc) to clear data and cache. I was frustrated by the long series of clicks I need to do to reach that page. That's when the idea of DevDash was born. The DevDash Widget is meant to provide an easy access to common tasks in the development process.
